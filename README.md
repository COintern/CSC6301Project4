Here's how the program works:

Import the necessary classes from the Collections Framework, including LinkedList and Collections.

Create a LinkedList called numbers to store the input integers.

Use a Scanner to read integers from the user until a non-integer input is encountered.

The integers are added to the numbers LinkedList as they are read.

After reading all input, we use the Collections.sort() method to sort the numbers LinkedList in ascending order.

Finally, we iterate through the sorted list and display the sorted integers.
